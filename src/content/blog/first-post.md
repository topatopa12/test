    Create a free account at Netlify if you do not already have one.

    Make a note of your username. You will view your dashboard and any sites you create at https://app.netlify.com/teams/username

    Click Add new site > Import an existing project.

    You will be asked to connect to a Git provider. Choose GitHub and follow the steps onscreen to authenticate your GitHub account. Then, choose your Astro project’s GitHub repository from the list provided.

    At the final step, Netlify will show you your app’s site settings. The defaults should be correct for your Astro project, so you can scroll down and click Deploy site.

Congratulations, you have an Astro website!
